# EcoEnsemble
Website initially created when I was a Tech Fellow in [CodePath's 101 Web Development Course.](https://www.codepath.org/courses/web-development)

I revisited the old site and decided to update it with a cleaner look, something I had wanted to do at the end of the course. 

Thanks to Cloudflare Pages, the site is deployed for you to see [here.](https://eco-ensemble.pages.dev/)

## Technologies Used
- JS, HTML, CSS
- Cloudflare Pages
