    <h3>Educate Yourself</h3>
    <p>Start with accessible resources like documentaries and articles to grasp the basics. Dive deeper by exploring
      scientific reports and books written by experts. Take online courses or attend local events, stay updated, and
      develop critical thinking skills to distinguish reliable sources from misinformation. Sharing your knowledge with
      others can also help raise awareness and inspire collective action.

    <h3>What Is Natural?</h3>
    <p>With the technological advancements made, it is impossible to live for more than a second without having some
      impact on the environment. It can be the clothes that you wear, the heating in your house, to your smartphone; an
      environmental cost was made to give you these privileges. Thus, a term was coined: carbon footprint. To the
      average person, this can invoke fear and guilt; the idea that your use of technology and advancements is pushing
      the Earth towards its limitations. It makes them more conscious of their lifestyle, driving them to believe that a
      ‚Äúnatural‚Äù lifestyle, can help the Earth.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="revealable rev-impact">
    <h3>How Much Do You Contribute?</h3>
    <p>The truth is that the idea of a ‚Äúcarbon footprint‚Äù gives the public tunnel vision. They become blinded towards
      what companies and institutions are doing, instead, choosing to focus on their own individual impacts. Yet, just
      take one moment to question, is it realistic to compare a person‚Äôs, or a family‚Äôs impact on the Earth compared to
      a company or a factory? The answer is no, yet not obvious when the market is driven towards promoting a ‚Äúnatural‚Äù
      lifestyle. All of a sudden, recycling that extra plastic bottle or using a paper straw seems trivial. This
      presents the limitations of the ecological footprint. Calculating one‚Äôs footprint proves how little impact they
      have in the face of companies and institutions. This does not mean to not care about your contributions, but to
      instead think about the greater picture.

    <h3>Reduce Your Carbon Footprint</h3>
    <p>Reducing your carbon footprint involves making conscious choices to minimize your contribution to greenhouse gas
      emissions. You can achieve this by adopting energy-efficient practices, such as using LED bulbs, reducing energy
      consumption, and opting for public transportation or carpooling. Supporting renewable energy sources like solar or
      wind power for your home and advocating for sustainable policies are essential steps to help mitigate climate
      change.
